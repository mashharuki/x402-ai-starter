# Code Style and Conventions

*   **TypeScript:** The project uses TypeScript with strict mode enabled, so type safety is important.
*   **Package Manager:** The project uses `pnpm` as the package manager.
*   **CSS:** The project uses Tailwind CSS with `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for utility-first CSS and managing conditional classes.
*   **Data Validation:** Data validation is handled with Zod schemas.
*   **Imports:** The project uses a path alias `@/*` for imports from the `src` directory.
*   **Builds:** TypeScript and ESLint errors are ignored during builds.
